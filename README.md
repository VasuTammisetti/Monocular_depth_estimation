## Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) for Monocular Depth Estimation

The Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) model is a state-of-the-art deep learning model designed for monocular depth estimation. It was introduced in the paper **Vision Transformers for Dense Prediction** by Ranftl et al. (2021). The model leverages the powerful Vision Transformer (ViT) as its backbone and enhances it with additional neck and head components specifically tailored for the task of depth estimation.

### Key Features

- **Training Data**: The DPT model was trained on a vast dataset comprising 1.4 million images.
- **Architecture**: Utilizes the Vision Transformer (ViT) for its backbone, known for its strong performance in various vision tasks.
- **Purpose**: Specifically designed for monocular depth estimation, which involves predicting the depth of each pixel in a single image.
- **Paper**: The foundational concepts and methodologies are detailed in the paper by Ranftl et al. (2021).

For more details, refer to the original repository where the model was first released.
